 <h1>Black whole</h1>
 <p>A<strong> black hole</strong> is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that<strong> even light</strong> can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.

    Because no light can get out, people can't see<a href="openin:https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-k4.html;"> black holes</a>. They are invisible.</p>
    <p> Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes act<em> differently</em> than other stars.</p>
